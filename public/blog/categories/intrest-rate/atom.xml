<p>After a huge stimulatory push by the Fed; six years of interest rates at zero, and more than 4 Trillion dollars created by the Quantitative Easing program, we have witnessed a massive creation of new money. Perhaps the most important, as well as most substantiated economic theory, is that of inflation. Simply put, it states that more money in the economy results in more inflation. This begs the question: why is inflation so low?</p>

<p>There are two possible explanations for this low inflation. Either the economy has grown enormously and in pace with the creation of new money, or, that this new money was created but is not circulating in the economy. The first option is clearly not the case, so we are left with the second. Indeed, for there to be inflation, the median income must rise. Since it has not, it indeed looks as if all this newly created money is “stuck” somewhere. To find where it is hiding, we need to “follow the money”.</p>

<p>Money might be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in more than one place. Also, the money is being pushed into an economy that may not be perfectly situated to translate it into economic growth. For example an interesting relation to explore is how income inequality affects the flow of money and in turn inflation. If only a small percent of the population is getting richer, this might not translate into higher costs of goods and services, or at least not all of them. If few people can afford to bid higher, price cannot rise much. This, as well as other causes for low inflation are well worth exploring.</p>

<p>When looking at the mechanism used by the Fed to infuse new money into the world we see other causes as well. To affect the relative cost of money and borrowing, the Fed buys various securities from financial institutions. These are mostly government bonds, but as part of QE, also included mortgage backed securities. By buying these securities from financial institutions, the Fed is supplying those institutions with cash. The idea is that banks will use this money to provide loans to the public and to business, thus “stimulating the economy”. Some of the money provided by the Fed has indeed gone this way. Mortgage rates have been low, providing cheap loans to the public as well. But since median income has not risen significantly, the money is not freely flowing out of banks.</p>

<p>One very important role of the Federal reserve as a central bank, is that it requires banks to hold 10% of their deposits on reserve at the Fed. This is done to insure the availability of cash in hopes of avoiding bank failure in the situation of rapid deposit withdrawal. This means that banks are required to NOT lend out at least 10% of their deposits. Since banks make money from lending, banks only hold the required minimum amount on reserve at the Fed, choosing to lend out the remainder at the highest rate they can.</p>

<p>This all changed in 2008. As of yesterday, there are more than 2.5 Trillion dollars held held in EXCESS of the required minimum. That&rsquo;s a lot of money. It&rsquo;s almost one quarter of the entire amount of money in circulation in the United States. And it&rsquo;s just sitting there, idly, not circulating in the economy. This money was not always there. Such huge deposits at the Federal reserve, are a recent development. In the 50 years before 2008, excess reserves at the Fed never exceeded 15 Billion dollars, or less than 0.6% of what they currently are.</p>

<p><img src="/images/FedReserves.png" title="&lsquo;excess federal reserves over time&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>In 2006, Congress passed legislation that allowed the Fed to pay banks interest on money they deposited at the Federal Reserve. In 2008, the Fed, in its role as lender of last resort, acted quickly to provide money to the failing financial system, and prevented it from imploding. The Fed also understood that the infusion of so much new money into the world would inevitability cause inflation. The Fed then, for the first time ever, used it&rsquo;s new authority to pay interest on deposits held at the Fed. This created two options for banks to collect interest on their money. The first option is the one they always had; the interest payment on overnight loans of deposits held at the Fed (the good old Federal funds &ldquo;interest rate”). This rate averaged about 0.13% over the past six years. The second option available to banks, is the new interest payed to them directly by the Fed, on any deposits they have at the Federal reserve. This interest rate was set at 0.25%. While this is a very low rate, it is still double what can be achieved from the overnight inter bank loans. Whats more, all this is taking place during a time when banks are very reluctant to lend money (which is why the Fed had to act so drastically in the first place). In this environment, where banks don&rsquo;t want to lend, the Fed is buying securities from them (as part of QE), and at the same time promising to pay interest on any funds deposited back at the Fed, banks started depositing huge amounts of money at the Federal Reserve. Since the Fed is also the source of this money, it is as if the money never even left the Fed.</p>

<p>So that is how we ended up with a huge creation of new money, but with so much of it simply stock piling at the Fed and never leaving it. The Fed has been very successful at both preventing a collapse of the financial system, and at restoring confidence that it will continue to do whatever it takes to provide financial stability. By paying interest on deposits, the Fed has also been successful at controlling the flow of currency, and keeping inflation low throughout a period of massive stimulation. These two achievements, are both extremely impressive, and of the highest importance.</p>

<p>The untangling of the various crisis coping stimulatory plans is still ahead of us, as are many of the repercussions from them. The Quantitative Easing program ended in 2014. The next step is to gradually raise interest rates back to sustainable levels. This will begin in the next few months and interest rates will probably rise above 0.25% some time in the coming 12 months. When interest rates cross that level, banks will no longer be so eager to hold excess reserves at the Fed, and we will see the massive 2.5 Trillion dollar pile of money begin to exit the Federal reserve banks. If this happens too quickly, it may contribute to higher inflation. So the Fed has the task of raising its rate target and simultaneously easing the excess reserves into the economy at a slow pace. The Fed still has the authority to pay interest on these funds, and it can raise it&rsquo;s payment above 0.25%. So there will be a complicated need of raising the interest on deposits, in step with raising the (inter bank loan) federal funds rate target. This is no easy task, and it will take years, if not decades to carry out.</p>

<p>With such a huge creation of new money behind us, we are sure to see higher inflation over the next ten years. Let&rsquo;s hope that the Fed can manage this new phase of financial recuperation as successfully as they have been managing the crisis up till now, and that it can continue to keep inflation down as much as possible.</p>

<p>Following more than six consecutive years with a federal funds rate of zero, the Fed has indicated that they are looking to raise interest rates some time before the end of 2015. When interest rates will go up, stock prices will be pulled down. There are multiple reasons for this. One way that stock prices are affected by higher interest rates, is that higher interest rates translate into more expensive loans, making the recycling of debt, as well as new debt, more expensive. Another reason is that government bonds become a more attractive investment, and therefore divert money away from other investments. Higher interest rates can therefore result in less money flowing into the stock market, resulting in lower demand for stocks, and lower prices.</p>

<p>In addition, since this relationship is widely known, a broad expectation of future lower price levels forms whenever a broad expectation of future higher interest rates forms. For this reason, we are sure to see a drop in stock market price levels immediately following the rate raise announcement from the Fed. This drop in prices, at least in the short term, will be greater than the true economic effect of rate change, as it will be largely due to money managers attempting to avoid future (expected further) price decline. A self fulfilling prophecy of sorts. This might also be followed by later herd like behavior. That is, the drop in price itself may lead to more people wanting to sell.</p>

<p>The long term effects on market prices will depend on the long term interest rates to follow in the years to come. In the long term, the general weight rising interest rates will have on the market, will be relative to the duration of them rising, as well as the duration of a “high&#8221; interest rates environment. That is, the effect of interest rates on price levels is a cumulative one. The more time rates are rising (or not declining) the stronger the effect.</p>

<p>By far the most powerful determinant of stock prices are earnings. Over the past century, stocks have generally traded at around 15 times earnings. Interest rates, once established over a period of a few years, will push this multiple higher or lower. In periods of low interest rates (as we are in right now) stocks may trade at an earnings multiple close to 20. While long periods of high interest rates can push the market downwards to trade at an earnings multiple lower than 15. Earnings do not stay constant over time. Over a short period of a couple years, earnings may decrease significantly or increase significantly. Generally, over the past century, earnings have increased slightly every year, even after allowing for inflation.</p>

<p>To get a broader picture of what can be expected in the US stock market over the next ten to twenty years, lets assume that earnings, overall, will continue to increase slightly at a rate of 2% a year (which is a reasonable to optimistic future). This means earnings will increase by about 20% (in total) in ten years, and by 50% in twenty. If interest rates increase significantly (say to above 8%) over this period, we can assume that stocks will trade at a lower multiple of earnings. If, for example they trade at around 12 times earnings, the market will see trading at price levels about 25% lower than today, ten years from now, and about 10% lower than today twenty years from now.</p>

<p>We can also examine the future possible returns if interest rates rise, but still stay in a “low” range, of about 2-6% over the next twenty years, while still assuming that earnings will grow by 2% every year. If we guess stocks will trade at a multiple of 16 times earnings under these interest rates, then ten years from now stocks will trade at roughly the same prices as they do today. Under these same assumptions stocks will be trading about 20% higher in twenty years, which works out to just under a 1% annual return.</p>

<p>Bottom line: You can safely expect a drop in stock prices to immediately follow the upcoming announcement from the Fed that they are raising their target for the federal funds rate. What will happen afterwards, strongly depends on the Fed&rsquo;s management of interest rates in the years to come. If stocks are bought at current prices, then even under relatively positive assumptions of consistent increases in corporate earnings as well as relatively low interest rates, returns can be expected to be low over the next ten to twenty years.</p>
