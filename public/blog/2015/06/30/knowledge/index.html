<p>To reach a deep, nuanced and rich understanding in any field, takes years of concentrated and energetic effort. Because of the extent of time required to develop expertise, and the relative shortness of human lifespan in comparison, developing more than one area of expertise is rare. Whats more, often, an irrational attraction to a certain subject is needed to sustain long periods of focus required for reaching a deep understanding in it. This adds to the rarity of acquiring a high skill level in multiple areas. Adding master level knowledge in a new area is exponentially rarer with each added discipline. A master of one discipline is valuable to others. A master of two disciplines is more than twice as valuable, and more than twice as rare.</p>

<p>Human knowledge is growing from day to day, and has long ago far exceeded any one man&rsquo;s ability to contain even a small fraction of it. Even if one is the most knowledgeable human on the planet in one field of expertise, there are so many other fields where he is at best a novice, that inevitably he will have to consult others.</p>

<p>Only the master of his discipline can know that he is wrong. Other people lack the knowledge to spot his mistake. If the non-master where to look for a mistake, they would have to study all aspects of the issue, thus becoming a master themselves. This would take time and effort, and could never be successful on a large scale by non-experts. The person best posed to spot any mistakes is the master himself.</p>

<p>If human knowledge is vast beyond a single man&rsquo;s ability to contain it, and the only one who can spot a mistake in a given area (as well as give good answers in that same area) is the master himself, this means that no matter how much knowledge we acquire in one area, we will undoubtedly need to consult others about many issues, and have no choice but to take their words on blind faith.</p>

<p>It then becomes of immense importance to develop some way of being able to tell who indeed is an expert, and who&rsquo;s words can indeed be granted this blind faith that we are forced to bestow on others.</p>

<p>Since only the expert can tell if they are right or wrong, It is of utmost importance that they indeed try to do so. If they do not second guess themselves, and regularly re-asses their own judgment, no one will be able to do so for them.</p>

<p>In turn, this also becomes the most important tool I know of to judge who indeed is an expert. If I need to take the advice or judgment of another person on some matter I know little about, (an occasion that comes up every day of every human&rsquo;s life), it is valuable for me to asses to what degree I can indeed take their words to be true. Superficial fact checking is of value, and can weed out the blatant mistakes, but is of limited use in more complex issues, and becomes exceedingly time consuming. The best signal by which to asses the validity of other&rsquo;s judgment that I know of is indirect, and relies on the way they present their opinions and conclusions. The more doubt is in them, the more trustworthy they appear.</p>

<p>If the expert expresses doubt, they are rechecking their own judgment. That is all I can ask for. They may, and indeed will, make mistakes from time to time as well. The admittance of mistakes, especially if self found, is also a strong indicator of true expertise. The more you study a subject, the more you realize the difficulties and complexity of that subject. A man that shows no hint of his own struggles to gain an understanding, most likely never gained a deep understanding. A man who constantly reevaluates his own knowledge, is constantly learnings and expanding his own knowledge.
This is the most powerful tool I know of in evaluating other&rsquo;s level of expertise in areas where I lack expertise myself (and therefore cannot judge theirs directly). I have found this tool incredibly valuable, but of course it is far from perfect. The skill of judging another person&rsquo;s expertise is in itself a skill, and like all other skills, takes years to acquire a proficient ability at, and is never perfected.</p>

<p>I believe the value of this skill is unique, as it allows to vicariously and indirectly acquire knowledge (based on trust) in other areas, that one could never possibly acquire in one lifetime on their own. Therefore, learning and developing it is an extremely worthwhile pursuit for all people. Many people naturally, or subconsciously develop it, while others, usually unknowingly, use trust directly and with no filter. At least at first.</p>

<p>This later approach is problematic, since it does not make an effort to reduce the number of mistakes that are taken as fact. It therefore adds to the number of contradictions and errors in ones thinking. If this goes on for to long, it can lead to added frustration and the reduction of trust in others. Very often, when one can no longer juggle these contradictions or handle the frustration, this process ends with the current set of random beliefs fixed as permanent, followed by the refusal to acquire new and potentially correct ones, as well as a breakdown of the healthy ability to trust in others. This halt in learning, places the mind in a permanent state of confusion and error. The mind may also deceive itself to think that it “has learned enough” or that it has reached the last stage of learning. Both ideas are of course impossible. Sadly, this often happens at a young age, and many people go through life in this state, reducing from their own enjoyment of life, and in turn reducing their ability to help others.</p>

<p>Some practical corollaries to summarize:</p>

<p>1) We must be able to trust others, without this, we will only experience and achieve a tiny fraction of what can be experienced and achieved.</p>

<p>2) It is of the utmost importance to try and make a judgment call before plunging into blind belief (as contradictory as that may sound), and to reevaluate this judgment from time to time.</p>

<p>3) We must be accepting of our own mistakes and short comings. We must live in comfort with the unknown, and with the inevitable dependency on others. Not being able to do so will lead us to jump at potentially wrong answers, and halt, or even over turn, or own never ending improvement.</p>

<p>Most importantly:</p>

<p>I) We should abhor intentional misleading, deception, and trickery, since the consequences of these can grow and multiply over time. These are obstacles to the improvement of mankind. Since we are so dependent on each other, the deception and corruption of one human, can spread like a plague in society. There should be no tolerance for this.</p>

<p>II) From a strictly pragmatic standpoint, we should hold sincerity and truthfulness in the utmost regard. You can be correct once by chance, and you can be wrong once by chance. The ability to make sure that you are right more often then you are wrong, as well as the ability to correct mistakes, stems from sincerity of thought. Again, since we are so dependent on each other, the development and improvement of one person, can and will, benefit others.</p>

<p>The highest form of social arrangement, is one in which there is an overwhelmingly common disposition of justified trust. To sustain and grow this trust, it should never be taken for granted.</p>
