<p>To reach a deep, nuanced and rich understanding in any field, takes years of concentrated and energetic effort. Because of the extent of time required to develop expertise, and the relative shortness of human lifespan in comparison, developing more than one area of expertise is rare. Whats more, often, an irrational attraction to a certain subject is needed to sustain long periods of focus required for reaching a deep understanding in it. This adds to the rarity of acquiring a high skill level in multiple areas. Adding master level knowledge in a new area is exponentially rarer with each added discipline. A master of one discipline is valuable to others. A master of two disciplines is more than twice as valuable, and more than twice as rare.</p>

<p>Human knowledge is growing from day to day, and has long ago far exceeded any one man&rsquo;s ability to contain even a small fraction of it. Even if one is the most knowledgeable human on the planet in one field of expertise, there are so many other fields where he is at best a novice, that inevitably he will have to consult others.</p>

<p>Only the master of his discipline can know that he is wrong. Other people lack the knowledge to spot his mistake. If the non-master where to look for a mistake, they would have to study all aspects of the issue, thus becoming a master themselves. This would take time and effort, and could never be successful on a large scale by non-experts. The person best posed to spot any mistakes is the master himself.</p>

<p>If human knowledge is vast beyond a single man&rsquo;s ability to contain it, and the only one who can spot a mistake in a given area (as well as give good answers in that same area) is the master himself, this means that no matter how much knowledge we acquire in one area, we will undoubtedly need to consult others about many issues, and have no choice but to take their words on blind faith.</p>

<p>It then becomes of immense importance to develop some way of being able to tell who indeed is an expert, and who&rsquo;s words can indeed be granted this blind faith that we are forced to bestow on others.</p>

<p>Since only the expert can tell if they are right or wrong, It is of utmost importance that they indeed try to do so. If they do not second guess themselves, and regularly re-asses their own judgment, no one will be able to do so for them.</p>

<p>In turn, this also becomes the most important tool I know of to judge who indeed is an expert. If I need to take the advice or judgment of another person on some matter I know little about, (an occasion that comes up every day of every human&rsquo;s life), it is valuable for me to asses to what degree I can indeed take their words to be true. Superficial fact checking is of value, and can weed out the blatant mistakes, but is of limited use in more complex issues, and becomes exceedingly time consuming. The best signal by which to asses the validity of other&rsquo;s judgment that I know of is indirect, and relies on the way they present their opinions and conclusions. The more doubt is in them, the more trustworthy they appear.</p>

<p>If the expert expresses doubt, they are rechecking their own judgment. That is all I can ask for. They may, and indeed will, make mistakes from time to time as well. The admittance of mistakes, especially if self found, is also a strong indicator of true expertise. The more you study a subject, the more you realize the difficulties and complexity of that subject. A man that shows no hint of his own struggles to gain an understanding, most likely never gained a deep understanding. A man who constantly reevaluates his own knowledge, is constantly learnings and expanding his own knowledge.
This is the most powerful tool I know of in evaluating other&rsquo;s level of expertise in areas where I lack expertise myself (and therefore cannot judge theirs directly). I have found this tool incredibly valuable. The skill of judging another person&rsquo;s expertise is in itself a skill, and like all other skills, takes years to acquire a proficient ability at, and is never perfected.</p>

<p>I believe the value of this skill is unique, as it allows to vicariously and indirectly acquire knowledge (based on trust) in other areas, that one could never possibly acquire in one lifetime on their own. Therefore, learning and developing it is an extremely worthwhile pursuit for all people. Many people naturally, or subconsciously develop it, while others, usually unknowingly, use trust directly and with no filter. At least at first.</p>

<p>This later approach is problematic, since it does not make an effort to reduce the number of mistakes that are taken as fact. It therefore adds to the number of contradictions and errors in ones thinking. If this goes on for to long, it can lead to added frustration and the reduction of trust in others. Very often, when one can no longer juggle these contradictions or handle the frustration, this process ends with the current set of random beliefs fixed as permanent, followed by the refusal to acquire new and potentially correct ones, as well as a breakdown of the healthy ability to trust in others. This halt in learning, places the mind in a permanent state of confusion and error. The mind may also deceive itself to think that it “has learned enough” or that it has reached the last stage of learning. Both ideas are of course impossible. Sadly, this often happens at a young age, and many people go through life in this state, reducing from their own enjoyment of life, and in turn reducing their ability to help others.</p>

<p>Some practical corollaries to summarize:</p>

<p>1) We must be able to trust others, without this, we will only experience and achieve a tiny fraction of what can be experienced and achieved.</p>

<p>2) It is of the utmost importance to try and make a judgment call before plunging into blind belief (as contradictory as that may sound), and to reevaluate this judgment from time to time.</p>

<p>3) We must be accepting of our own mistakes and short comings. We must live in comfort with the unknown, and with the inevitable dependency on others. Not being able to do so will lead us to jump at potentially wrong answers, and halt, or even over turn, or own never ending improvement.</p>

<p>Most importantly:</p>

<p>I) We should abhor intentional misleading, deception, and trickery, since the consequences of these can grow and multiply over time. These are obstacles to the improvement of mankind. Since we are so dependent on each other, the deception and corruption of one human, can spread like a plague in society. There should be no tolerance for this.</p>

<p>II) From a strictly pragmatic standpoint, we should hold sincerity and truthfulness in the utmost regard. You can be correct once by chance, and you can be wrong once by chance. The ability to make sure that you are right more often then you are wrong, as well as the ability to correct mistakes, stems from sincerity of thought. Again, since we are so dependent on each other, the development and improvement of one person, can and will, benefit others.</p>

<p>The highest form of social arrangement, is one in which there is an overwhelmingly common disposition of justified trust. To sustain and grow this trust, it should never be taken for granted.</p>

<p>After a huge stimulatory push by the Fed; six years of interest rates at zero, and more than 4 Trillion dollars created by the Quantitative Easing program, we have witnessed a massive creation of new money. Perhaps the most important, as well as most substantiated economic theory, is that of inflation. Simply put, it states that more money in the economy results in more inflation. This begs the question: why is inflation so low?</p>

<p>There are two possible explanations for this low inflation. Either the economy has grown enormously and in pace with the creation of new money, or, that this new money was created but is not circulating in the economy. The first option is clearly not the case, so we are left with the second. Indeed, for there to be inflation, the median income must rise. Since it has not, it indeed looks as if all this newly created money is “stuck” somewhere. To find where it is hiding, we need to “follow the money”.</p>

<p>Money might be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in more than one place. Also, the money is being pushed into an economy that may not be perfectly situated to translate it into economic growth. For example an interesting relation to explore is how income inequality affects the flow of money and in turn inflation. If only a small percent of the population is getting richer, this might not translate into higher cost of goods and services, or at least not all of them. If few people can afford to bid higher, price cannot rise much. This, as well as other causes for low inflation are well worth exploring.</p>

<p>When looking at the mechanism used by the Fed to infuse new money into the world we see other causes as well. To affect the relative cost of money and borrowing, the Fed buys various securities from financial institutions. These are mostly government bonds, but as part of QE, also included mortgage backed securities. By buying these securities from financial institutions, the Fed is supplying those institutions with cash. The idea is that banks will use this money to provide loans to the public and to business, thus “stimulating the economy”. Some of the money provided by the Fed has indeed gone this way. Mortgage rates have been low, providing cheap loans to the public as well. But since median income has not risen significantly, the money is not freely flowing out of banks.</p>

<p>One very important role of the Federal reserve as a central bank, is that it requires banks to hold 10% of their deposits on reserve at the Fed. This is done to insure the availability of cash in hopes of avoiding bank failure in the situation of rapid deposit withdrawal. This means that banks are required to NOT lend out at least 10% of their deposits. Since banks make money from lending, banks only hold the required minimum amount on reserve at the Fed, choosing to lend out the remainder at the highest rate they can.</p>

<p>This all changed in 2008. As of yesterday, there are more than 2.5 Trillion dollars held held in EXCESS of the required minimum. That&rsquo;s a lot of money. It&rsquo;s almost one quarter of the entire amount of money in circulation in the United States. And it&rsquo;s just sitting there, idly, not circulating in the economy. This money was not always there. Such huge deposits at the Federal reserve, are a recent development. In the 50 years before 2008, excess reserves at the Fed never exceeded 15 Billion dollars, or less than 0.6% of what they currently are.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.danielgelbart.com/images/FedReserves.png" title="'excess federal reserves over time'" ></p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>In 2006, Congress passed legislation that allowed the Fed to pay banks interest on money they deposited at the Federal Reserve. In 2008, the Fed, in its role as lender of last resort, acted quickly to provide money to the failing financial system, and prevented it from imploding. The Fed also understood that the infusion of so much new money into the world would inevitability cause inflation. The Fed then, for the first time ever, used it&rsquo;s new authority to pay interest on deposits held at the Fed. This created two options for banks to collect interest on their money. The first option is the one they always had; the interest payment on overnight loans of deposits held at the Fed (the good old Federal funds &ldquo;interest rate”). This rate averaged about 0.13% over the past six years. The second option available to banks, is the new interest payed to them directly by the Fed, on any deposits they have at the Federal reserve. This interest rate was set at 0.25%. While this is a very low rate, it is still double what can be achieved from the overnight inter bank loans. Whats more, all this is taking place during a time when banks are very reluctant to lend money (which is why the Fed had to act so drastically in the first place). In this environment, where banks don&rsquo;t want to lend, the Fed is buying securities from them (as part of QE), and at the same time promising to pay interest on any funds deposited back at the Fed, banks started depositing huge amounts of money at the Federal Reserve. Since the Fed is also the source of this money, it is as if the money never even left the Fed.</p>

<p>So that is how we ended up with a huge creation of new money, but with so much of it simply stock piling at the Fed and never leaving it. The Fed has been very successful at both preventing a collapse of the financial system, and at restoring confidence that it will continue to do whatever it takes to provide financial stability. By paying interest on deposits, the Fed has also been successful at controlling the flow of currency, and keeping inflation low throughout a period of massive stimulation. These two achievements, are both extremely impressive, and of the highest importance.</p>

<p>The untangling of the various crisis coping stimulatory plans is still ahead of us, as are many of the repercussions from them. The Quantitative Easing program ended in 2014. The next step is to gradually raise interest rates back to sustainable levels. This will begin in the next few months and interest rates will probably rise above 0.25% some time in the coming 12 months. When interest rates cross that level, banks will no longer be so eager to hold excess reserves at the Fed, and we will see the massive 2.5 Trillion dollar pile of money begin to exit the Federal reserve banks. If this happens too quickly, it may contribute to higher inflation. So the Fed has the task of raising its rate target and simultaneously easing the excess reserves into the economy at a slow pace. The Fed still has the authority to pay interest on these funds, and it can raise it&rsquo;s payment above 0.25%. So there will be a complicated need of raising the interest on deposits, in step with raising the (inter bank loan) federal funds rate target. This is no easy task, and it will take years, if not decades to carry out.</p>

<p>With such a huge creation of new money behind us, we are sure to see higher inflation over the next ten years. Let&rsquo;s hope that the Fed can manage this new phase of financial recuperation as successfully as they have been managing the crisis up till now, and that it can continue to keep inflation down as much as possible.</p>

    <link href="http://www.danielgelbart.com/blog/2015/04/22/interest-rates-and-their-effect-on-stock-prices/"/>

<p>Following more than six consecutive years with a federal funds rate of zero, the Fed has indicated that they are looking to raise interest rates some time before the end of 2015. When interest rates will go up, stock prices will be pulled down. There are multiple reasons for this. One way that stock prices are affected by higher interest rates, is that higher interest rates translate into more expensive loans, making the recycling of debt, as well as new debt, more expensive. Another reason is that government bonds become a more attractive investment, and therefore divert money away from other investments. Higher interest rates can therefore result in less money flowing into the stock market, resulting in lower demand for stocks, and lower prices.</p>

<p>In addition, since this relationship is widely known, a broad expectation of future lower price levels forms whenever a broad expectation of future higher interest rates forms. For this reason, we are sure to see a drop in stock market price levels immediately following the rate raise announcement from the Fed. This drop in prices, at least in the short term, will be greater than the true economic effect of rate change, as it will be largely due to money managers attempting to avoid future (expected further) price decline. A self fulfilling prophecy of sorts. This might also be followed by later herd like behavior. That is, the drop in price itself may lead to more people wanting to sell.</p>

<p>The long term effects on market prices will depend on the long term interest rates to follow in the years to come. In the long term, the general weight rising interest rates will have on the market, will be relative to the duration of them rising, as well as the duration of a “high&#8221; interest rates environment. That is, the effect of interest rates on price levels is a cumulative one. The more time rates are rising (or not declining) the stronger the effect.</p>

<p>By far the most powerful determinant of stock prices are earnings. Over the past century, stocks have generally traded at around 15 times earnings. Interest rates, once established over a period of a few years, will push this multiple higher or lower. In periods of low interest rates (as we are in right now) stocks may trade at an earnings multiple close to 20. While long periods of high interest rates can push the market downwards to trade at an earnings multiple lower than 15. Earnings do not stay constant over time. Over a short period of a couple years, earnings may decrease significantly or increase significantly. Generally, over the past century, earnings have increased slightly every year, even after allowing for inflation.</p>

<p>To get a broader picture of what can be expected in the US stock market over the next ten to twenty years, lets assume that earnings, overall, will continue to increase slightly at a rate of 2% a year (which is a reasonable to optimistic future). This means earnings will increase by about 20% (in total) in ten years, and by 50% in twenty. If interest rates increase significantly (say to above 8%) over this period, we can assume that stocks will trade at a lower multiple of earnings. If, for example they trade at around 12 times earnings, the market will see trading at price levels about 25% lower than today, ten years from now, and about 10% lower than today twenty years from now.</p>

<p>We can also examine the future possible returns if interest rates rise, but still stay in a “low” range, of about 2-6% over the next twenty years, while still assuming that earnings will grow by 2% every year. If we guess stocks will trade at a multiple of 16 times earnings under these interest rates, then ten years from now stocks will trade at roughly the same prices as they do today. Under these same assumptions stocks will be trading about 20% higher in twenty years, which works out to just under a 1% annual return.</p>

<p>Bottom line: You can safely expect a drop in stock prices to immediately follow the upcoming announcement from the Fed that they are raising their target for the federal funds rate. What will happen afterwards, strongly depends on the Fed&rsquo;s management of interest rates in the years to come. If stocks are bought at current prices, then even under relatively positive assumptions of consistent increases in corporate earnings as well as relatively low interest rates, returns can be expected to be low over the next ten to twenty years.</p>
